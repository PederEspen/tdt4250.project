### Fetch from API and transform from JSON to java objects

The fetching is handled in the tdt4250.project project, inside /src/transformation/JSONtoModel.java file.
Here the data is saved to JSON files that we later use to create java classes. (Her vi bruke Jackson?)

The JavaMToEcoreM.java file creates a XMI file that we use together 
with Sirius to create the visualization of viewer and editor. This is done by using a custom model to 
model transformation.
